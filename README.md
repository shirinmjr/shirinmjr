<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shirin</h1>
<p >
As a software engineer at General Assembly, I am learning and applying the latest technologies and best practices in web development, such as MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS, Django, Python, and JavaScript. I am also enhancing my skills in data structures, algorithms, DOM, and Big O notation, and building projects that showcase my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
</p>
<p>
Before joining General Assembly, I worked as a senior software development engineer in test at StoryBlocks and SAIC, where I ensured the quality and compliance of enterprise-grade applications and platforms for Health and Human Services. I built automation testing frameworks using Selenium, facilitated Agile transitions, and worked as a scrum master for various teams. I have a strong educational background in electrical engineering and cybersecurity, with a B.S. from University of Maryland University College and a B.E. from Islamic Azad University. I also hold multiple certifications in Java and ISTQB.
</p>
<p>
I am passionate about engineering the future, one line of code at a time, and delivering exceptional results that meet the needs and expectations of users and clients. I have strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills, and I pay attention to details and follow best practices. I am always eager to learn new things, collaborate with others, and challenge myself.
